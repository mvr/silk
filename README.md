Silk: a CUDA drifter searcher
=============================

![Silk logo](./docs/silk.jpg)

This is a CGoL drifter search program inspired by Mitchell Riley's
[Barrister](https://github.com/mvr/barrister). We port the underlying
algorithm, modulo a few tweaks, from Barrister to CUDA to benefit
from the greater parallelism present on GPUs.
